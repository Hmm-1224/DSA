# Train Route Optimizer

This project implements a train route optimizer using data structures such as hash maps, tries, and the KMP algorithm for efficient data retrieval, predictive text input, and pattern matching in user reviews.

## Features

- **Hash Map**: Efficiently stores and retrieves train route information.
- **Trie**: Implements an auto-completion feature for predictive text input.
- **KMP Algorithm**: Analyzes user reviews using efficient pattern matching.

## Prerequisites

- C++11 or later compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hmm-1224/train_route_optimizer.git
   cd train_route_optimizer
